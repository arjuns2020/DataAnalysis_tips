# first, I specify the Lasso Regression model, ( Lassoo accounts to 0)
# select a suitable alpha (equivalent of penalty).
# The bigger the alpha the less features that will be selected.

# Then I use the selectFromModel object from sklearn, which
# will select the features which coefficients are non-zero

sel_ = SelectFromModel(Lasso(alpha=0.005, random_state=0)) # remember to set the seed, the random state in this function
sel_.fit(X_train, y_train)

# this command let's us visualise those features that were kept.
# Kept features have a True indicator
sel_.get_support()

# let's print the number of total and selected features

# this is how we can make a list of the selected features
selected_feat = X_train.columns[(sel_.get_support())]

# let's print some stats
print('total features: {}'.format((X_train.shape[1])))
print('selected features: {}'.format(len(selected_feat)))
print('features with coefficients shrank to zero: {}'.format(

# print the selected features
